# Temperature prediction using ARIMA model

## Description of the project
This project focuses on forecasting temperature trends using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Temperature prediction is crucial for various applications, including climate monitoring, agriculture, and energy management. By leveraging historical temperature data, the ARIMA model can effectively capture temporal patterns and generate accurate short-term forecasts.

## Expected Outcome:
A reliable temperature prediction model that provides insights into future temperature trends based on historical data, aiding decision-making in weather-sensitive industries.
